## Configuration parameters

The following parameters are specified in an `ExponeaConfiguration` object. Refer to [lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-flutter-sdk/blob/main/lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart) for the complete Dart definition.

* `projectToken` **(required)**
   * Your project token. You can find this in the Engagement web app under `Project settings` > `Access management` > `API`.

* `authorization` **(required)**
   * Your Engagement API key.
   * The token must be an Engagement **public** key. See [Mobile SDKs API Access Management](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/mobile-sdks-api-access-management) for details.
   * For more information, refer to [Exponea API documentation](https://docs.exponea.com/reference#access-keys).

* `baseURL`
  * Your API base URL which can be found in the Engagement web app under `Project settings` > `Access management` > `API`.
  * Default value `https://api.exponea.com`.
  * If you have custom base URL, you must set this property.

* `projectMapping`
  * If you need to track some events to a different Engagement project, you can define a mapping between event types and Engagement projects.
  * An event is always tracked to the default project and any projects it is mapped to.
  * Example:
    ```dart
    projectMapping: {
      EventType.banner: [
        ExponeaProject(
          projectToken: 'other-project-token',
          authorizationToken: 'other-auth-token',
        ),
      ],
    }
    ```
  
* `defaultProperties`
  * A list of properties to include in all tracking events.
  * You can change these properties at runtime by calling `ExponeaPlugin().setDefaultProperties()`.
  * You can also override default session event properties. For example, if you don't want to track the customer's IP address, you can include the property `ip` with an empty string value.

* `automaticSessionTracking`
  * Flag to control the automatic tracking of `session_start` and `session_end` events.
  * Default value: `true`

* `sessionTimeout`
  * The session is the actual time spent in the app. It starts when the app is launched and ends when the app goes into the background.
  * When the application goes into the background, the SDK doesn't track the end of the session right away but waits a bit for the user to come back before doing so. You can configure the timeout by setting this property.
  * Read more about [Tracking Sessions](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/flutter-sdk-tracking#session)

* `pushTokenTrackingFrequency`
  * Indicates the frequency with which the SDK should track the push notification token to Engagement.
  * Default value: `TokenFrequency.onTokenChange`
  * Possible values:
    * `.onTokenChange` - tracks push token if it differs from a previously tracked one
    * `.everyLaunch` - always tracks push token
    * `.daily` - tracks push token once per day

* `requirePushAuthorization`
  * Flag indicating whether the SDK should check [push notification permission status](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission) and [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsettings/1648391-authorizationstatus) and only track the push token if the user granted permission to receive push notifications.
  * Possible values:
    * `true` - tracks the push token only if the user granted permission to receive push notifications. An empty token value is tracked if the user denied permission. This is useful to send normal push notifications to a target audience that allows receiving notifications.
    * `false` - tracks the push token regardless of notification permission status. This is useful to send silent push notifications that do not require permission from the user.
  * Default value: `false` (Android) / `true` (iOS)

* `flushMaxRetries`
  * Controls how many times the SDK should attempt to flush an event before aborting. Useful for example in case the API is down or some other temporary error happens.
  * The SDK will consider the data to be flushed if this number is exceeded and delete the data from the queue.
  * Default value: `10`

* `advancedAuthEnabled`
  * If set, advanced authorization is used for communication with the Engagement APIs listed in [Customer Token Authorization](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/flutter-sdk-authorization#customer-token-authorization).
  * Refer to the [authorization documentation](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/flutter-sdk-authorization) for details.

* `inAppContentBlockPlaceholdersAutoLoad`
  * Automatically load the contents of in-app content blocks assigned to these Placeholder IDs.

* `android`
  * `AndroidExponeaConfiguration` object containing [Android-specific configuration parameters](#android-specific-configuration-parameters).

* `ios`
  * `IOSExponeaConfiguration` object containing [iOS-specific configuration parameters](#ios-specific-configuration-parameters).

### Android-specific configuration parameters

The following parameters are specified in an `AndroidExponeaConfiguration` object. Refer to [lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-flutter-sdk/blob/main/lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart) for the complete Dart definition

* `automaticPushNotifications`
  * By default, the SDK will set up a Firebase service and try to process push notifications sent from the Engagement platform automatically. You can opt out by setting this to `false`.
  * Default value: `true`

* `pushIcon`
  * Android resource ID of the icon to be used for push notifications.

* `pushAccentColor`
  * Accent color of push notification icon and buttons.

* `pushChannelName`
  * Name of the channel to be created for the push notifications.
  * Only available for API level 26+. Refer to https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels for details.

* `pushChannelDescription`
  * Description of the channel to be created for the push notifications.
  * Only available for API level 26+. Refer to https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels for details.

* `pushChannelId`
  * Channel ID for push notifications.
  * Only available for API level 26+. Refer to https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels for details.

* `pushNotificationImportance`
  * Notification importance for the notification channel.
  * Only available for API level 26+. Refer to https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels for details.

* `httpLoggingLevel`
  * Level of HTTP request/response logging.

* `allowWebViewCookies`
  * Flag to enable or disable cookies in WebViews.
  * Default value: `false`
  * > ❗️
    >
    > **Disclaimer**:
    > * For security purposes, cookies are by default disabled in WebViews.
    > * This setting has effect on all WebViews in the application, NOT ONLY the ones used by the SDK.
    > * DO NOT CHANGE THIS SETTING unless you know the risks associated with enabling and storing cookies.
    > * By changing this setting and enabling cookies in WebViews you take full responsibility for any security vulnerabilities or incidents caused by them.

* `appInboxDetailImageInset`
  * Defines margin-top of Image in App Inbox detail screen in dp. Default value (null) will result in `?attr/actionBarSize` defined in application theme. This is useful in case of transparent toolbar theming.


### iOS-specific configuration parameters

The following parameters are specified in an `IOSExponeaConfiguration` object. Refer to [lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-flutter-sdk/blob/main/lib/src/data/model/configuration.dart) for the complete Dart definition

* `requirePushAuthorization` - DEPRECATED
  * The SDK can check push notification authorization status ([Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsettings/1648391-authorizationstatus)) and only track the push token if the user is authorized to receive push notifications.
  * When disabled, the SDK will automatically register for push notifications on app start and track the token to Engagement so your app can receive silent push notifications.
  * When enabled, the SDK will automatically register for push notifications if the app is authorized to show push notifications to the user.
  * Unless you're only using silent notifications, keep the default value `true`.

* `appGroup`
  * App group used for communication between the main app and notification extensions. This is a required field for rich push notification setup.
