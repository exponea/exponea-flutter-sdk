# Flutter Exponea SDK
Flutter Exponea SDK allows your application to interact with the [Bloomreach Engagement](https://www.bloomreach.com/) Customer Data & Experience Platform. Exponea empowers B2C marketers to raise conversion rates, improve acquisition ROI, and maximize customer lifetime value.

Flutter SDK is implemented as a wrapper around [native Android SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-android-sdk) and [native iOS SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-ios-sdk).

> Bloomreach Engagement was formerly known as Exponea. For backward compatibility, the Exponea name continues to be used in the Flutter SDK.

## Getting started
In your projects `pubspec.yaml` file, add dependency to Flutter Exponea SDK:

```

### iOS setup

* `$ cd ios`
* `$ pod install`

Minimal supported iOS version for Exponea SDK is 11.0, you may need to change iOS version on the first line of your `ios/Podfile` to `platform :ios, '11.0'`, or higher.

### Android setup
